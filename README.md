# Slasher

## Theme

* Imposter feels like viscious serial murder spree
* Crewmate feels like a stealth master ninja

## Rules

### In-game rules

**Imposter**
* Low vision
* Low kill distance
* Low kill duration

**Crewmate**
* High vision
* ??? num tasks

**All**
* High move speed

**Map**
* ???

### House rules

Many of these rules are enforced via honor system (not by the game itself)

1. **No voting**: Players are never allowed to report a murder or call an emergency meeting. The crewmates' only win condition is completing their tasks.
1. **Public Imposter**: There is 1 imposter. At start of match, imposter will verbally anounce who they are and **leave** the discord room.
1. **Crewmate coordination**: Alive crewmates are allowed to talk throughout the entire game. Dead crewmates are not allowed to talk, except for the first few seconds after dying (e.g. to convey that they died, where they died, where the imposter is headed next)
1. **Leaving spawn**: Crewmates are not allowed to leave the spawn room until 10 seconds into the match (to give time for imposter to leave discord channel). Imposter is not allowed to leave the spawn room until 20 seconds into the match.

### Gameplay and End game

Besides the rules above, the game is played out the same. The imposter tries to win by killing the required amount of crewmates. The crewmates try to win by completing tasks. Dead crewmates should attempt to complete their t asks; reminder: they are not allowed to talk or convey information to the crewmates who are still alive.

## Balancing

To make easier for imposter:
* Map with more dead-ends
* Slight vision/kill distance increase
* Add more tasks
* Add an imposter

To make easier for crewmates
* Map with less dead-ends
* Less tasks
